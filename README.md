# AlienInvaders
In this repository you can find an AlienInvaders game. It was made with Java and an external library called simpleGraphics. This is the project me and my team presented with 5 days for completion, and after only 4 weeks into learning to code!

You need to have the typicall tools to run a java program in your machine, as there is no .jar file in there.

The commands are:
 - A,D for movement.
 - Space to shoot.
